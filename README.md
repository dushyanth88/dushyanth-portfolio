As a **Skilled Fullstack Developer** with proficiency across the entire web stack, this project represents my commitment to building high-quality, hostable web solutions. While the current site is built on a responsive static frontend, my expertise extends deeply into backend engineering, often utilizing **Python** for robust server-side logic and application development. I am dedicated to continuously strengthening my technical knowledge and demonstrating my ability to **design, develop, and deploy fully functional web applications**.
